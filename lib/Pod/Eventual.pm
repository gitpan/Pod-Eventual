=head1 NAME

Pod::Eventual - read a POD document as a series of trivial events

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Your::Pod::Parser;
    use base 'Pod::Eventual';

    sub handle_event {
      my ($self, $event) = @_;

      print Dumper($event);
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

POD is a pretty simple format to write, but it can be a big pain to deal with
reading it and doing anything useful with it.  Most existing POD parsers care
about semantics, like whether a C<=item> occurred after an C<=over> but before
a C<back>, figuring out how to link a C<< LE<lt>E<gt> >>, and other things like
that.

Pod::Eventual is much less ambitious and much more stupid.  Fortunately, stupid
is often better.  (That's what I keep telling myself, anyway.)

Pod::Eventual reads line-based input and produces events describing each POD
paragraph or directive it finds.  Once complete events are immediately passed
to the C<handle_event> method.  This method should be implemented by
Pod::Eventual subclasses.  If it isn't, Pod::Eventual's own C<handle_event>
will be called, and will raise an exception.

=head1 EVENTS

There are three kinds of events that Pod::Eventual will produce.  All are
represented as hash references.

=head2 Command Events

These events represent commands -- those things that start with an equals sign
in the first column.  Here are some examples of POD and the event that would be
produced.

A simple header:

    =head1 NAME

    { type => 'command', command => 'head1', content => "NAME\n", start_line => 4 }

Notice that the content includes the trailing newline.  That's to maintain
similarity with this possibly-surprising case:

    =for HTML
    We're actually still in the command event, here.

    {
      type    => 'command',
      command => 'for',
      content => "HTML\nWe're actually still in the command event, here.\n",
      start_line => 8,
    }

Pod::Eventual does not care what the command is.  It doesn't keep track of what
it's seen or whether you've used a command that isn't defined.  The only
special case is C<=cut>, which is never more than one line.

    =cut
    We are no longer parsing POD when this line is read.

    { type => 'command', command => 'cut', content => "\n", start_line => 15 }

Waiving this special case may be an option in the future.

=head2 Text Events

A text event is just a paragraph of text, beginning after one or more empty
lines and running until the next empty line (or F<=cut>).  The only special
rule is that a text event's first line must not be indented, or it will become
a verbatim event.

Text events look like this:

    { type => 'text', content => "a string of text ending with a\n", start_line =>  16 }

=head2 Verbatim Events

Verbatim events are identical to text events, but are created when the first
line of text begins with whitespace.  The only semantic difference is that
verbatim events should not be subject to interpretation as POD text (for things
like C<< LE<lt>E<gt> >> and so on).  They are often also rendered in monospace.

Pod::Eventual doesn't care.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 read_handle

    Pod::Eventual->read_handle($io_handle, \%arg);

This method iterates through the lines of a handle, producing events and
calling the C<handle_event> method.

The only valid argument in C<%arg> (for now) is C<in_pod>, which indicates
whether we should assume that we are parsing pod when we start parsing the
file.  By default, this is false.

This is useful to behave differently when reading a F<.pm> or F<.pod> file.

=head2 read_file

This behaves just like C<read_handle>, but expects a filename rather than a
handle.

=head2 read_string

This behaves just like C<read_handle>, but expects a string containing POD
rather than a handle.

=head2 handle_event

This method is called each time Pod::Evental finishes scanning for a new POD
event.  It must be implemented by a subclass or it will raise an exception.

=head2 handle_nonpod

This method is called each time a non-POD line is seen -- that is, lines after
C<=cut> and before another command.

If unimplemented by a subclass, it does nothing by default.
