=head1 ABOUT

This document includes typed regions with data paragraphs with blank lines as
well as verbatim paragraphs with blank lines.  We want either to have one event
per block-with-blank or to have sufficient information to reconstruct the
block.

  For example I have now begin a verbatim paragraph

  and despite the intervening blank I am still in it, and


  even several blank lines are included -- without loss -- in the final
  verbatim paragraph.

=begin data

Similarly, this paragraph

is actually one data para


with blank lines within.

=end data
